The application helps the user with a quick and easy score notation for the Whist game.

Normally for this game, a sheet of paper is used, a table is drawn and for each round, the score is noted and calculated. But the app does these things for users, generating a table based on the number of players and calculating the score for each round.

Moreover, it warns if wrong data has been entered or if players have not followed the rules during the round.
