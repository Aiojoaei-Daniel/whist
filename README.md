## Whist - Scoreboard

With a simple interface, the Front-End was built with JavaScript and React, and for the server side I used Firebase.

This application helps the user with quick and easy scoring for the Whist game.

Normally, this game requires a sheet of paper to draw a table on, but the app does this for users by generating a table based on the number of players and calculating the score for each round.

Moreover, it warns if wrong data has been entered or if players have not followed the rules during the round.

> This app was designed to be used on mobile phones, but it also works well on
> PCs.

The application can be accessed through the [Whist](https://whist-9598b.web.app/) link.
