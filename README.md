## Whist - Scoreboard


> This app was designed to be used on mobile phones, but it also works well on
> PCs.

With a simple interface, this application helps the user to score quickly and easily for the Whist game.
It is composed of:

 - JavaScript and React to create the Front-End
 - Firebase for the server side

Normally, this game requires a sheet of paper to draw a table on, but the app does this for users by generating a table based on the number of players and calculating the score for each round.

Moreover, it warns if wrong data has been entered or if players have not followed the rules during the round.

The application can be accessed through the [Whist](https://whist-9598b.web.app/) link.
